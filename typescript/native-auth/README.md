# Security Implications

This project is provided as example code to demonstrate the integration and usage of the Microsoft Entra ID Native Auth SDK in web applications (including React Next.js and Angular samples). **It is not intended for production use and does not include all security controls required for a secure, real-world deployment.**

## Important Security Considerations for Developers

Before using this codebase as a foundation for your own application, you must review and implement additional security measures to protect your users and data. The following areas are especially critical:

### 1. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection
- **Current State:** The sample authentication forms (sign-in, sign-up, password reset, etc.) do not implement any CSRF protection mechanisms. There are no anti-CSRF tokens, custom headers, or request origin validation in place.
- **Risk:** Without CSRF protection, attackers could craft malicious websites that silently submit requests on behalf of authenticated users, potentially leading to account takeover, forced actions, identity theft, or session hijacking.
- **Developer Action:** You must implement robust CSRF protection in your production application. This typically involves generating a unique, unpredictable token for each user session, embedding it in forms or request headers, and validating it server-side for every state-changing request.

### 2. Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) Configuration
- **Current State:** The sample CORS proxy/server is configured with an overly permissive policy, allowing requests from any origin (`*`) and enabling credentials. This is for demonstration purposes only.
- **Risk:** An insecure CORS configuration can allow malicious websites to make authenticated requests to your API endpoints, leading to information disclosure, CSRF facilitation, or session hijacking.
- **Developer Action:** In production, always restrict CORS to a specific list of trusted domains. If you need to support multiple origins, implement server-side logic to validate the `Origin` header against a whitelist. Never use a wildcard (`*`) origin in combination with `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true`.

## Additional Recommendations
- Review all authentication, authorization, and session management logic for security best practices.
- Follow industry standards and compliance requirements relevant to your application and users.
- Regularly test your application for vulnerabilities using automated tools and manual review.

**Summary:**
This sample is for demonstration purposes only. It is your responsibility as a developer to ensure that all necessary security controls are implemented and validated before deploying any application based on this code to a live environment.
